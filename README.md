# Hospitality Reservation Analysis

This project analyzes hotel reservation data to uncover patterns in bookings, room types, property performance, and revenue. It showcases my ability to clean and prepare data, explore trends, and extract actionable insights using SQL.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to understand how customers book rooms across different properties, identify trends in room types, stay duration, and revenue, and provide insights that could help improve hotel operations and profitability.

## What I Did

- Cleaned the dataset by removing duplicates and fixing incorrect or inconsistent data

- Converted columns to the correct data types and standardized binary values (like Yes/No flags)

- Extracted useful features such as the day of the week from check-in dates

- Corrected errors in the Rate_Type column (weekend vs weekday)

- Performed analysis on booking patterns, room types, stay durations, revenue, and occupancy

## Key Findings

- Certain days of the week and months see more bookings than others

- Suites and deluxe rooms have higher average rates, but occupancy varies by property

- Advanced bookings and special requests impact booking trends

- Some properties and room types generate significantly more revenue than others

- Longer stays and higher number of occupants tend to correlate with higher revenue

## Recommendations

- Optimize room availability and staffing based on peak booking days

- Focus marketing on high-demand room types and properties

- Adjust pricing strategies using insights from revenue patterns

- Consider targeted promotions for advanced bookings and special requests
